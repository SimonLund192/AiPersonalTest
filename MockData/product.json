Need for Speed SHIFT takes players in a different direction to create a simulation experience that replicates the true feeling of driving high-end performance cars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers are thrust into the loud, visceral, intense, athletic experience of racing a car on the edge of control from the driver\u2019s perspective through the combination of perception based G-forces, the hyper reality of the cockpit view, and the brutal experience of a first person crash dynamic. Need for Speed SHIFT features an accurate, accessible physics-based driving model that allows you to feel every impact, every change of track surface and every last bit of grip as you push yourself to the edge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe all-new driver profile is the ultimate extension of the true driver\u2019s experience. This system gives each player a unique persona based on a player\u2019s driving skill and style - aggressive or precise. Driver profile impacts how a player unlocks cars, overall career progression and online matchmaking. In Need for Speed SHIFT, how you drive is who you are behind the wheel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* True Driver\u2019s Experience \u2013 A variety of visual cues delivers the true driver\u2019s experience including a three-dimensional HUD that mimics driver head movement, inertia and G-forces. The depth of field also adjusts based on the speed of the car; so when the car is traveling at high speeds the perspective will shift to the distance putting the car/cockpit out of focus.<br />\r\n* Driver Profile \u2013 What kind of driver are you? Driver profile tracks the player\u2019s evolution as a race driver from event to event. This system is made up of a driver\u2019s personality on the track, their success rate and any profile points and badges accrued all of which work together to create a tailor-made career and game play experience. Driver profile is pervasive throughout all modes: career and online.<br />\r\n* Dynamic Crash Effect - When the player hits a static object or opponent car, the player will feel like they are 'taking damage'. A combination of visual and audio effects will leave the player disorientated and briefly disrupt the race.<br />\r\n* Total Customization \u2013 Need for Speed SHIFT features a comprehensive customization option that lets the player tailor every aspect of the cars performance and styling. Go under the hood to upgrade and tune your vehicle to increase its performance. The visual customization system allows players to personalize both the exterior and trick out the interior to reflect their individual style and preferences.<br />\r\n* Photo Real Cars and Tracks \u2013 Nearly 70 licensed cars are available including the Pagani Zonda F, Audi RS4, and Porsche 911 GT3 RSR. There is also over 15 real-world locations like Willow Springs and Laguna Seca as well as fictional circuits like downtown London and Tokyo.<br />\r\n\u00a0</p>\r\n"

The world is changing and Tropico is moving with the times - geographical powers rise and fall and the world market is dominated by new players with new demands and offers - and you, as El Presidente, face a whole new set of challenges. If you are to triumph over your naysayers you will need to gain as much support from your people as possible. Your decisions will shape the future of your nation, and more importantly, the size of your Swiss bank account.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTropico 4 features all new missions across new maps and includes exciting and fun new features to keep the action fresh and challenging. You can even elect ministers into power to help get your more controversial decisions passed through the government.

Post comments on Twitter direct from the game and have updates go out when you complete missions or unlock new achievements.

Tillsammans med sin kompis Stefan s\u00e5 driver han Sm\u00e5lands b\u00e4sta butik med utem\u00f6bler i konstrotting, dessutom drygar de ut kassan med att s\u00e4lja smuggelsprit och cigaretter svart.
